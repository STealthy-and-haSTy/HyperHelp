# Context Overview
==================

HyperHelp provides several |commands|, key contexts and an |api| that allow you
to customize the help experience for yourself or for users of your package by
creating your own custom key bindings, menu entries or plugins.

The key contexts listed here can be used in key bindings in order to ensure
that your bindings only take effect in the appropriate circumstances.


## hyperhelp.is_help_view
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help_view"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: `true`, `false`

This context yields `true` when the currently focused view in the current
window is a |help view|.


## hyperhelp.is_help_visible
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help_visible"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: `true`, `false`

This context yields `true` when the current window has a |help view| already
created within it. This is not an indication that the help view is currently
focused, only that it exists.


## hyperhelp.is_help
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: `true`, `false`

This context yields `true` when the currently focused view in the current
window contains a hyperhelp source file; that is, a file whose syntax indicates
that it is a HyperHelp help file.

This is true for any file using the appropriate syntax, which includes not only
the contents of the |help view| but also a help file that you might be
|:authoring.txt:authoring|.



## hyperhelp.is_help_source
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help_source"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: `true`, `false`

This context extends |hyperhelp.is_help| by only yielding `true` when the
current help file is a help file that is not being authored; that is, it is
marked as read-only.


## hyperhelp.is_help_index
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help_index"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: `true`, `false`

This context yields `true` when the currently focused view in the current
window contains a hyperhelp index file; that is, a file whose syntax indicates
that it is a HyperHelp index file.


## hyperhelp.is_help_package
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help_package"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: a string that is a package name

This context yields `true` when the current window contains a |help view| and
the currently displayed help file is displaying a help file for the given
package.


## hyperhelp.is_help_file
-------------------------

key: `"hyperhelp.is_help_file"`
operator: `"equal"`, `"not_equal"`
operand: a string that is a package name

This context yields `true` when the current window contains a |help view| and
the currently displayed help file has the same name as the help file given.
