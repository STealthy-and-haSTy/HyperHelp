# API Overview
==================

HyperHelp provides several |commands|, |key contexts| and an api that allow you
to customize the help experience for yourself or for users of your package by
creating your own custom key bindings, menu entries or plugins.

Since HyperHelp (more specifically |hyperhelpcore|, which provides the API) is
still under active development and subject to change without notice, the API is
not yet documented.
