# _none:Style Conventions
===================

In order to remain as consistent as possible for all users of help, HyperHelp
includes customized syntax specific settings for the |help view|.

    * `word_wrap` is disabled, so all help should optimally be presentable in
      no more than 80 characters of text. This matches the width of the
      generated |file header| in the displayed help.

    * `translate_tabs_to_spaces` is enabled for help files to ensure identical
      formatting for both the help author and the person viewing the help.


# _none:View Conventions
==================

In addition to the style rules outlined above, several settings are included in
the syntax specific settings of the |help view| in order to provide a cleaner
appearance.

    * `rulers` are disabled

    * `fade_fold_buttons` and `draw_indent_guides` are enabled and disabled
      respectively, since help text tends to be more free form and less code
      based, where indentation levels are less ordered.

    * `match_selection` is turned off to avoid visual noise when text is
      selected, such as when navigating between |anchors|
