# Bookmarks
===========

HyperHelp allows you to create bookmarks for help topics that you often use,
allowing you to jump back to them at any point. From within a |help view| you
can create a bookmark by pressing <b> or jump to an existing bookmark by
pressing <g>.

The command palette command `HyperHelp: Open Bookmarked Help Topic` is also
available from any view, and will navigate to a bookmarked help topic, creating
the help view if it doesn't already exist.


# Creating Bookmarks
--------------------

When you invoke the command to create a bookmark, HyperHelp will prompt you to
provide details on the bookmark to create; it's `type` and it's `name`.

The `type` of the bookmark determines what happens when you navigate to that
particular bookmark, while the `name` determines how it is displayed in the
bookmark list.


    ## File Bookmark
    ----------------

    A `file` bookmark bookmarks the file that you're currently viewing in the
    |help view|. When you navigate back to this bookmark, the cursor will be
    placed at the |anchor| in the |header| of the file after it's loaded.

    This is useful to bookmark a general help file, such as a reference
    document.


    ## View Bookmark
    ----------------

    A `view`bookmark bookmarks the current state of the |help view|. When you
    navigate back to this bookmark later, not only will the file open but the
    cursor and viewport will be put back into the exact same state as they were
    when the bookmark was created.

    This is useful to take a snapshot of the help before leaving to do other
    things and still being able to find your way back to where you left off.


    ## Topic Bookmark
    -----------------

    A `topic` bookmark is like a `file` bookmark, except that where the `file`
    bookmark creates a bookmark that opens a particular file, a `topic`
    bookmark bookmarks a specific topic instead.

    This type of bookmark is context sensitive; in order to be given this
    option for your bookmark, the cursor needs to be placed on top of a link to
    that topic first.

HyperHelp supports three different kinds of bookmarks that allow you to create
